# Classifying-Smokers-vs-Non-Smokers
This project aims to develop a classification model that predicts whether an individual is a smoker or non-smoker based on demographic and health-related factors. The dataset includes key attributes such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, region of residence, and medical charges.

By analyzing these features, the goal is to identify patterns and factors strongly associated with smoking behavior. This classification task not only enhances understanding of lifestyle-related risk factors but also supports health insurance companies in assessing risk profiles and optimizing premium pricing strategies.

The project involves data exploration, feature analysis, data preprocessing, and the use of machine learning algorithms (such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests) to accurately distinguish smokers from non-smokers.
